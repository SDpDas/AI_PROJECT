STEPS

1. imports cv2 and numpy packages
2. Capture the video
3. Reading video frames
4. Looping the video if necessary
5. Use Gaussian Blur
6. Apply Grayscale conversion
7. Set threshold for fixing colors
8. Use mask to hold the colors 
9. Detects edges
10. Use Hough Line Transform

Note: To detect more than 1 colors 
you have to make several mask and combine them

11. Finally show edges and frame
